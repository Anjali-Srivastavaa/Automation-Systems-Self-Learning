# Automation Systems – Self Learning

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of automation systems built as part of a structured self-learning program.

The goal of this project is to understand how real-world operational problems can be converted into automated workflows using logic-driven design rather than tool-specific hacks.

All workflows are built using **free tools** and focus on:
- Process thinking
- Data flow clarity
- Error handling
- Maintainable automation design

---

## Tools Used
- n8n (Desktop / Trial)
- Google Sheets
- Google Drive
- Gmail
- OpenAI (free / mocked prompts)
- GitHub (version control & documentation)

---

## Learning Approach
Each workflow in this repository follows a consistent approach:
1. Identify a manual or repetitive process
2. Break it into logical steps
3. Design a workflow with clear input/output
4. Implement automation in n8n
5. Document logic, assumptions, and limitations

This repository intentionally focuses on **design clarity and reasoning**, not just execution.

## Repository Structure
/docs
└── Design notes, explanations, and logic breakdowns

/workflows
└── Exported n8n workflows (JSON format)

/tasks
└── Task definitions and learning objectives

Each task is developed in a separate branch and merged only after completion.

---

## Workflow Design Principles
- Clear separation of triggers and actions
- Predictable data flow between nodes
- Minimal but meaningful logic
- Error awareness and failure points documented
- Readable and maintainable workflow structure

---

## Version Control Approach
- Main branch contains stable and documented work
- Each learning task is implemented in a dedicated branch
- Commits are small, descriptive, and intentional
- Workflow exports are versioned as JSON files

---

## Scope of This Repository
This repository represents:
- Independent self-learning work
- Simulated real-world automation problems
- Educational use of tools and concepts

It does **not** represent:
- Client work
- Company projects
- Production deployments

## Disclaimer
All workflows and examples in this repository are created purely for learning and demonstration purposes.

No real user data, proprietary information, or paid services are used.
