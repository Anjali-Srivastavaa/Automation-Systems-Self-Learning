# Day 01 – Workflow Foundations

## Objective
Understand the basic structure of an automation workflow and how data flows between nodes in n8n.

This task focuses on thinking in terms of **process logic**, not tools.

---

## Problem Statement
Manual reporting tasks often involve:
- Collecting data from a source
- Formatting it
- Sending it to stakeholders

The objective is to simulate this process using an automated workflow.

---

## Task Requirements
1. Create a simple n8n workflow that:
   - Uses a manual trigger
   - Reads sample data (static or Google Sheets)
   - Formats the data
   - Sends an output (email or console/log)

2. Focus on:
   - Node order
   - Data passed between nodes
   - Error-free execution

---

## Learning Goals
- Understand triggers vs actions
- Understand JSON data movement
- Learn how small logic mistakes break workflows

---

## Deliverables
- n8n workflow exported as JSON
- Short explanation of each node
- Notes on what could fail and why

---

## Notes
This task is intentionally simple.
Clarity and correctness matter more than complexity.
